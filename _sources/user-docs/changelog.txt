Changelog for version 1.1.0
---------------------------

* Flood assessment using polygons now generates evacuation totals based
  on percent of affected people (defaults to 1%).
* Improvements to error handling with more informative messages to user.
* Memory requirements prediction to try to warn a user when they might not
  have enough RAM. See https://github.com/AIFDR/inasafe/issues/476.
* Remote logging support. This **opt in** feature lets you submit useful
  diagnostic information to our fault logger at http://sentry.linfiniti.com.
* Support for automatic creation of packages in a test repository for
  early adopters to test with.
* Fix for 2D geometries - closes https://github.com/AIFDR/inasafe/issues/471
* Default dock panel to right of QGIS. Closes
  https://github.com/AIFDR/inasafe/issues/326
* Fix https://github.com/AIFDR/inasafe/issues/358
* Many small 'under the hood' improvements.
* Realtime quake mapping support. This is available in source tree only
  and is a server side installable application. Indonesia specific.
* Realtime flood mapping support. This is available in source tree only
  and provides an experimental implementation for production of floodmaps.
  Jakarta specific.

Changelog for version 1.0.1
---------------------------

* Fix https://github.com/AIFDR/inasafe/issues/374
* Fix https://github.com/AIFDR/inasafe/issues/375

Changelog for version 1.0.0
---------------------------

* Added post processor infrastructure including gender and age specific indicators
* Added data source attribution
* Various GUI updates
* Added use of transparency in generated maps
* Added an earthquake impact function
* Documentation updates
* Many bugfixes and architectural improvements
* Better internationalisation support

Changelog for version 0.5.2
---------------------------

* This is a bugfix update to address some minor translation issues in the
  InaSAFE package.

Changelog for version 0.5.1
---------------------------

* This is a bugfix update to reduce the size of the InaSAFE package.

Changelog for version 0.5.0
---------------------------

* Better documentation. See http://inasafe.org/contents.html
* Time stamp and other metadata added to generated map PDF.
* Initial support for parameterisation of impact functions.
* Updated logging infrastructure including support for logging to the
  QGIS log panel.
* Fixed missing InaSAFE icon in QGIS plugin manager.
* Fixes for help system under windows.
* Multi-page support for generated report PDF (which is now created as a
  separate document).
* Ability to combine polygon hazard  (such as flood prone areas) with
  population density.
* Option to use entire intersection of hazard and exposure instead of clipping
  to the somewhat arbitrary viewport (the training revealed that this was a bit
  confusing)
* Aggregation of raster impact layers by arbitrary polygon layers (such as
  kelurahan boundaries)
* Limited support for runtime configuration of impact functions (e.g. by
  changing thresholds). This is an interim measure while the team is working on
  a GUI to manipulate impact functions more generally.
* More DRR actions added to impact function reports (such as how will warnings
  be disseminated, how will we reach stranded people etc.)
* Volcanic (zonal hazard) impact assessments on building and population
* New function table view that lists all the available impact functions and allows
  them to be filtered by different criteria.
* Lots of small improvements to error reporting, GUI, translations and code quality.
