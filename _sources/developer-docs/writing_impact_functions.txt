Writing Impact Functions
========================

This document explains the purpose of impact functions and shows how to
write them. Some familiarity with the Python programming language will
be helpful to fully appreciate this section. See also :ref:`impact_functions`
for information about existing impact functions in InaSAFE.
Three examples of impact functions for common combinations of input types are
given in the sections :ref:`raster_raster`, :ref:`raster_vector` and :ref:`vector_vector`.

.. note:: This section is still work in progress

What is an impact function?
---------------------------

An impact function is a short Python code that InaSAFE calls to make
a specific analyses. All impact functions take as inputs one hazard layer
and one exposure layer. All impact functions return

* a layer that represents he result of the calculation (the impact layer).
* style information for the impact layer.
* a textual report typically summarising statistical information about the
  impact such as estimated fatilities or number of buildings affected.

Layers can be either raster or vector types. See :ref:`data_types`
for a complete list of admissible input layer types that can be sensibly
handled by impact functions.

Impact functions also specify which layer types they can work with and thus
directly control under which circumstances they are made available to the
user in the impact function menu. See :ref:`requires` for more details.


Creating impact functions
-------------------------

All impact functions follow a particular overall structure as outlined below:

Import required modules
.......................

This section identifies functionality that is needed for the impact
function in question.
As a minimum, one must import functionality specific to the impact
function framework, but depending on the usage other standard Python modules
may be imported here. A minimal import section contains:
::
    from safe.impact_functions.core import (FunctionProvider,
                                            get_hazard_layer,
                                            get_exposure_layer,
                                            get_question,
                                            get_function_title)

    from safe.common.tables import Table, TableRow

The imported elements are

.. FIXME (Ole): Create links to docstrings for each of these symbols. But how?
.. For the moment I put in absolute urls, but that isn't robust if things change

`FunctionProvider <http://inasafe.org/api-docs/safe/impact_functions/core.html#safe.impact_functions.core.FunctionProvider>`_
    Base class that all impact function classes must inherit from for InaSAFE to recognise them. Click on link or see examples below for more details.

`get_hazard_layer <http://inasafe.org/api-docs/safe/impact_functions/core.html#safe.impact_functions.core.get_hazard_layer>`_
    Helper function to extract hazard layer from input.

`get_exposure_layer <http://inasafe.org/api-docs/safe/impact_functions/core.html#safe.impact_functions.core.get_exposure_layer>`_)
    Helper function to extract exposure layer from input.

`get_question <http://inasafe.org/api-docs/safe/impact_functions/core.html#safe.impact_functions.core.get_question>`_
    Function to paraphrase the selected scenario based on titles of hazard, exposure and impact function.

`get_function_title <http://inasafe.org/api-docs/safe/impact_functions/core.html#safe.impact_functions.core.get_function_title>`_
    Helper function which provides title of impact function.

`Table <http://inasafe.org/api-docs/safe/common/tables.html#safe.common.tables.Table>`_
    Class for representing tables for use in the InaSAFE reports.

`TableRow <http://inasafe.org/api-docs/safe/common/tables.html#safe.common.tables.TableRow>`_
    Class for representing one table row in a table.



Additionally, and depending on the type of the resulting layer, a typical import section will include either:
::

    from safe.storage.raster import Raster

or:
::
    from safe.storage.vector import Vector

See `Raster <http://inasafe.org/api-docs/safe/storage/raster.html#module-safe.storage.raster>`_ and `Vector <http://inasafe.org/api-docs/safe/storage/raster.html#module-safe.storage.vector>`_ documentation for details.

Define the impact function class
................................

The impact function is represented by a Python class. It must inherit from the class ``FunctionProvider``
which is what will make it part of the InaSAFE system:

::

    class SomeImpactFunction(FunctionProvider):
        """Example impact function

The impact function class must have some special tags in its docstring which are used to identify it and decide which layer types it is valid for. They are:

:author: Name of the individual or organisation who wrote the impact function
:rating: A numeric rating from 1 to 4 signifying a quality rating of the function (1 is worst and 4 is best). This is used in conjunction with similar ratings of input layers and combined into a rating of the resulting impact layer. The idea is that a final result is never better than the worst of the inputs and the calculation.
:param requires: This precedes an arbitrary boolean expression combining statements involving keyword and values. The expression must be valid Python statements and the keywords and values must be defined for each input layer - e.g. by using the keywords editor or by manually editing the keywords file. One keyword, layertype, which takes the values 'raster' or 'vector' is always present and is inferred automatically by InaSAFE. For more information about keywords please refer to :ref:`keywords_system` and refer to the examples below.

Following the docstring is a collection of variables that define and document the impact function. They are

:title: Specifies the title of the impact function as displayed in the InaSAFE user interface
:parameters: A (possibly ordered) dictionary of parameters that can be configured from the
             user interface. Anything listed here can be modified at runtime by clicking the pencil
	     symbol next to the impact function. In this case it is the threshold used to define
	     what water level signals evacuation.

In addition, there is a collection of text variables used for various levels of documentation of this impact function. They are ``synopsis``, ``actions``, ``detailed_description``, ``permissible_hazard_input``, ``permissible_exposure_input`` and ``limitation``. See examples below for more possible usages.

Impact function for raster hazard and raster exposure data
----------------------------------------------------------

The example below is a simple impact function that calculates an
expected number of people in need of evacuation in a flood event as
well as an estimate of supplies required.

Import section
..............

This section identifies functionality that is needed for the impact function in question.
As a minimum, one must import functionality specific to the impact function framework, but
in this case we also need ``numpy`` for computations, ``tables`` for reporting and ``raster``
to form the resulting impact layer:

::

    import numpy
    from safe.impact_functions.core import (FunctionProvider,
                                            get_hazard_layer,
                                            get_exposure_layer,
                                            get_question,
                                            get_function_title)

    from safe.common.tables import Table, TableRow
    from safe.storage.raster import Raster



Impact function class
.....................

The impact function itself is embodied in a Python class with a doc string:

::

    class FloodPopulationEvacuationFunction(FunctionProvider):
        """Impact function for flood evacuation (tutorial)

        :author AIFDR
        :rating 4
        :param requires category=='hazard' and \
                        subcategory in ['flood', 'tsunami'] and \
                        layertype=='raster' and \
                        unit=='m'

        :param requires category=='exposure' and \
                        subcategory=='population' and \
                        layertype=='raster'
        """

        title = 'be evacuated'

        synopsis = ('To assess the impacts of (flood or tsunami) inundation '
                    'on population.')
        actions = ('Provide details about how many people would likely need '
                   'to be evacuated, where they are located and what resources '
                   'would be required to support them.')
        detailed_description = ('The population subject to inundation '
                                'exceeding a threshold (default 1m) is '
                                'calculated and returned as a raster layer.'
                                'In addition the total number and the required '
                                'needs in terms of the BNPB (Perka 7) ')

        permissible_hazard_input = ('A hazard raster layer where each cell '
                                    'represents flood depth (in meters).')
        permissible_exposure_input = ('An exposure raster layer where each '
                                      'cell '
                                      'represent population count.')
        limitation = ('The default threshold of 1 meter was selected based on '
                      'consensus, not hard evidence.')

        parameters = {'threshold': 1.0}


The class name ``FloodPopulationEvacuationFunction`` is used to uniquely
identify this impact function and it is important to make sure that no
two impact functions share the same class name. If they do, one of them
will be ignored.

The doc string defines the author, the rating and the requirements that input layers must fulfil for this impact function. In this case, there must be a hazard layer with subcategory of either 'flood' or 'tsunami', with layertype being 'raster' and unit of meters. The other input must be tagged as 'exposure' with subcategory 'population' and also having layertype 'raster'. Except for layertype which is automatically inferred by InaSAFE all other keywords must be specified with each layer e.g. by using the InaSAFE keyword editor or by manually editing the keywords file. See also :ref:`keywords_system`.

The rest of this section comprise the documentation variables and the parameters dictionary which in this case makes one variable available for interactive modification from the user interface. In this case, the threshold used to determine whether people should be evacuated is made configurable. The default value is set to 1m.


Impact function algorithm
.........................

The actual calculation of the impact function is specified as a method call called ``run``. This
method will be called by InaSAFE with a list of the 2 selected layers:

::

    def run(self, layers):
        """Impact function for flood population evacuation

        Input
          layers: List of layers expected to contain
              H: Raster layer of flood depth
              P: Raster layer of population data on the same grid as H

        Counts number of people exposed to flood levels exceeding
        specified threshold.

        Return
          Map of population exposed to flood levels exceeding the threshold
          Table with number of people evacuated and supplies required
        """

        # Identify hazard and exposure layers
        inundation = get_hazard_layer(layers)  # Flood inundation [m]
        population = get_exposure_layer(layers)

        question = get_question(inundation.get_name(),
                                population.get_name(),
                                self)


The typical way to start the calculation is to explicitly get a handle to the hazard
layer and the exposure layer. In this case we name them as ``inundation`` and ``population``
respectively.

We also use a built-in function ``get_question`` to paraphrase the selected scenario based on titles of hazard, exposure and impact function. For example, if the hazard and exposure layers had titles "A flood in Jakarta like in 2007" and "People", then the paraphrased question for this impact function would become:

    In the event of *a flood in Jakarta like in 2007* how many *people* might *be evacuated*.


The next typical step is to extract the numerical data to be used. In this case we
assign the configurable parameter ``threshold`` to a variable of the same name, and because
both input layers are raster data (we know this because of the requirements section) we take the
numerical data as arrays. InaSAFE has a preprocessing step that automatically reprojects, aligns,
resamples and possibly rescales data so that the impact function can assume the two arrays are
compatible and be used safely in numerical calculations:

::

        # Determine depths above which people are regarded affected [m]
        # Use thresholds from inundation layer if specified
        threshold = self.parameters['threshold']

        # Extract data as numeric arrays
        D = inundation.get_data(nan=0.0)  # Depth

        # Calculate impact as population exposed to depths > max threshold
        P = population.get_data(nan=0.0, scaling=True)


The method ``get_data()`` returns an array if the layer is raster and takes two arguments:

:nan: Specify the value to use where nodata is available. In this case we use 0.0 as we only want to count hazard pixels with flooding and exposure pixels with non-zero population.
:scaling: Optional argument controlling if data is to be scaled. In this case we set it to True which means that if the corresponding raster layer was resampled by InaSAFE, the values will be correctly scaled by the squared ratio between its current and native resolution.

.. note:: # FIXME (Ole): Tim - how do we cross reference docstrings? The problem is that we can't drop labels into them because they are auto-generated?

See :ref:/api-docs/safe/storage/raster.html#safe.storage.raster.Raster.get_data for more details on
the ``get_data()`` method.

Now we are ready to implement the desired calculation. In this case it is very simple as
we just want to sum over population pixels where the inundation depth exceeds the threshold.
As both inundation and population are numpy arrays, this is achieved by the code:

::

        # Create new array with positive population counts only for
        # pixels where inundation exceeds threshold.
        I = numpy.where(D >= threshold, P, 0)

        # Count population thus exposed to inundation
        evacuated = int(numpy.sum(I))

        # Count total population
        total = int(numpy.sum(P))

We can now use this estimate to calculate the needs required. In this case
it is based on an Indonesian standard:

::

        # Calculate estimated needs based on BNPB Perka 7/2008 minimum bantuan

        # 400g per person per day
        rice = int(evacuated * 2.8)

        # 2.5L per person per day
        drinking_water = int(evacuated * 17.5)

        # 15L per person per day
        water = int(evacuated * 105)

        # assume 5 people per family (not in perka)
        family_kits = int(evacuated / 5)

        # 20 people per toilet
        toilets = int(evacuated / 20)


With all calculations complete, we can now generate a report. This usually takes
the form of a table and InaSAFE provide some primitives for generating table rows etc.
InaSAFE operates with two tables, impact_table which is put on the printable map and
impact_summary which is shown on the screen. They can be identical but are usually slightly
different. We also define a title for the generated map:

::

        # Generate impact report for the pdf map
        table_body = [question,
                      TableRow([('People in %.1f m of water' %
                                 threshold),
                                '%s' % evacuated],
                               header=True),
                      TableRow('Map shows population density needing '
                               'evacuation'),
                      TableRow(['Needs per week', 'Total'],
                               header=True),
            ['Rice [kg]', rice],
            ['Drinking Water [l]', drinking_water],
            ['Clean Water [l]', water],
            ['Family Kits', family_kits],
            ['Toilets', toilets]]
        impact_table = Table(table_body).toNewlineFreeString()

        # Extend impact report for on-screen display
        table_body.extend([TableRow('Notes', header=True),
                           'Total population: %s' % total,
                           'People need evacuation if flood levels '
                           'exceed %(eps).1f m' % {'eps': threshold},
                           'Minimum needs are defined in BNPB '
                           'regulation 7/2008'])
        impact_summary = Table(table_body).toNewlineFreeString()

        map_title = 'People in need of evacuation'


The impact grid calculated above must be displayed as a layer so needs some appropriate colouring.
In this case we define 8 classes and assign a colour for each. We set the lowest class to be
transparent and the others solid as that will give a nice visual appearance showing only areas
that are impacted. We label class 1 as low,
class 4 as medium and class 7 as high:

::

        # Generate 8 equidistant classes across the range of flooded population
        # 8 is the number of classes in the predefined flood population style
        # as imported
        classes = numpy.linspace(numpy.nanmin(I.flat[:]),
                                 numpy.nanmax(I.flat[:]), 8)

        # Define 8 colours - on for each class
        colours = ['#FFFFFF', '#38A800', '#79C900', '#CEED00',
                   '#FFCC00', '#FF6600', '#FF0000', '#7A0000']

        # Create style associating each class with a colour and transparency.
        style_classes = []
        for i, cls in enumerate(classes):
            if i == 0:
                # Smallest class has 100% transparency
                transparency = 100
            else:
                # All the others are solid
                transparency = 0

            # Create labels for three of the classes
            if i == 1:
                label = 'Low [%.2f people/cell]' % cls
            elif i == 4:
                label = 'Medium [%.2f people/cell]' % cls
            elif i == 7:
                label = 'High [%.2f people/cell]' % cls
            else:
                label = ''

            # Style dictionary for this class
            d = dict(colour=colours[i],
                     quantity=cls,
                     transparency=transparency,
                     label=label)
            style_classes.append(d)

        # Create style info for impact layer
        style_info = dict(target_field=None,  # Only for vector data
                          legend_title='Population Density',
                          style_classes=style_classes)


Finally, we create and return a new raster object based on the calculated impact grid ``I``.
We also assign
the same projection and geotransform as the hazard layer, give it a suitable name, pass the tables and title as keywords and provide the generated style.

InaSAFE assumes that every impact function returns a raster or vector layer.
::

        # Create raster object and return
        R = Raster(I,
                   projection=inundation.get_projection(),
                   geotransform=inundation.get_geotransform(),
                   name='Population which %s' % get_function_title(self),
                   keywords={'impact_summary': impact_summary,
                             'impact_table': impact_table,
                             'map_title': map_title},
                   style_info=style_info)
        return R

.. _raster_vector:

Impact function for raster hazard and vector (point or polygon) exposure data
---------------------------------------------------------------

The example below is a simple impact function that identifies which
buildings (vector data) will be affected by earthquake ground shaking
(raster data).


TBA

.. _vector_vector:

Impact function for polygon hazard and vector point exposure data
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The example below is a simple impact function that identifies which
buildings (vector data) will be affected by certain volcanic hazard areas (vector polygon data).


TBA

Assigning hazard values to exposure data
----------------------------------------

In many cases, there is a need to tag the exposure layer with values from the hazard layer in order to calculate the impact.
Typical examples include interpolation from gridded hazard data to point data (interpolation), from polygon hazard data to point data or, indeed, from polygon data to gridded population data. InaSAFE provides one general mechanism for this purpose called ``assign_hazard_values_to_exposure_data''and it is typically called in the beginning of the impact function to generate an intermediate layer that has all information about both hazard and exposure. A call looks like:

::

   I = assign_hazard_values_to_exposure_data(H, E,
                                             attribute_name='depth')

In this case H could be either raster or polygon vector data and E polygon or point vector data. In either case the result I
represents the exposure data but with an additional attribute added containing the hazard level. If H is polygon data, all its attributes will
be transferred to I. If H is raster_data and hence has only one value, that value will be assigned to a new attribute in I as specified by
the keyword argument attribute_name - in this example 'depth'. See full documentation of this function in section :ref:`data_types`.





Deploying new impact functions
------------------------------

To make a new impact function visible to InaSAFE it has to be placed in a subdirectory under
safe/impact_functions relative to where it is installed. This will typically be something like
.qgis/python/plugins/inasafe.

There are a number of subdirectories with existing impact functions organised by hazard.
The new impact function can use either of them or be located in a new subdirectory with
the same __init_.py file as the existing ones.

Next time InaSAFE is loaded, the new impact function will be included and provided its
keywords match those of the input layers it will be available to run.




.. _requires:

Controlling which layer types impact functions work with
--------------------------------------------------------

Each impact function has a requirements section embedded in its doc string
that specifies which
type of input layers it can work with. The requirements take the form of one or more
statements that specify which keywords and values input layers must have for the
impact function to run. InaSAFE uses this mechanism to determine which impact
functions appear in the menu for a given selection of hazard and exposure layers.

For example, the impact function for earthquake fatality estimation which works
with two raster input layers has the requirements section

::

    :param requires category=='hazard' and \
                    subcategory=='earthquake' and \
                    layertype=='raster' and \
                    unit=='MMI'

    :param requires category=='exposure' and \
                    subcategory=='population' and \
                    layertype=='raster'


This means that the impact function will only be selected if it is presented with two input layers
whose associated keywords match these requirements. For more information about keywords please refer to :ref:`keywords_system`.
