<h1>InaSAFE Documentation<a class="headerlink" href="#project-name-documentation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p><strong>INDONESIA SCENARIO ASSESSMENT FOR EMERGENCIES</strong> (InaSAFE) is free software
that produces realistic natural hazard impact scenarios for better planning,
preparedness and response activities.</p>
<div class="section" id="concept">
<h2>Concept<a class="headerlink" href="#concept" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To effectively prepare for future floods, earthquakes or tsunami you must first
understand the likely impacts that need to be managed. For example, to prepare
contingency plans for a severe flood in Jakarta, emergency managers need to
answer questions like:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>what are the areas likely to be affected;</li>
<li>how many people will need to be evacuated and sheltered;</li>
<li>which schools will be closed;</li>
<li>which hospitals can still take patients; and</li>
<li>what roads will be closed?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-does-it-work">
<h2>How does it work?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-does-it-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>InaSAFE provides a simple but rigorous way to combine data from scientists,
local governments and communities to provide insights into the likely impacts
of future disaster events. The software is focused on examining, in detail,
the impacts by a single hazard would have on specific sectors. e.g. location of
primary schools and estimated number of students affected by a possible tsunami
in Maumere (when it happened during the school hours).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="who-can-use-it">
<h2>Who can use it?<a class="headerlink" href="#who-can-use-it" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Anyone with basic computer skills can quickly learn to use InaSAFE to explore
the potential impacts of a disaster event and to produce maps and reports of
these impacts. The software leads a user through the process of asking a
specific question and has tools to estimate the likely damage that a hazard
will cause to people and critical infrastructure such as schools, hospitals,
roads, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Because the software is free and open, more advanced users can also add new
questions and data from new sectors</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="where-does-the-data-come-from">
<h2>Where does the data come from?<a class="headerlink" href="#where-does-the-data-come-from" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Effectively preparing for a disaster requires people from a wide range of
sectors and backgrounds to effectively work together and share their
experience, expertise, and resources. Using InaSAFE to develop a scenario
requires the same spirit of cooperation and sharing of expertise
and data.</p>
<p>InaSAFE is designed to use and combine existing data from science agencies,
local governments, and communities themselves. Normally, information on the
location of people and important assets are provided by local communities and
government departments responsible for each sector, often through a facilitated
part of a disaster preparedness and planning exercise.</p>
<p>Where appropriate spatial data doesn’t yet exist, external tools such as
OpenStreetMap (www.LearnOSM.org) can allow governments and communities to
quickly and easily map their assets that are important to them.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">It is important to note that InaSAFE is not a hazard modeling tool.
Information on hazards needs to be provided either by technical experts,
often from Government agencies, universities or technical consultants, or
from communities themselves based on their previous experiences.</p>
</div>
<p>The more communities, scientists and governments share data and knowledge, the
more realistic and useful the InaSAFE scenario will be.</p>
<p>InaSAFE was conceived and initially developed by the Indonesia’s National
Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), the Australian Agency for International
Development (AusAID) and the World Bank.</p>

<p>The latest source code is available at

 which contains modules for risk calculations, gis functionality and functions for impact modelling.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="limitations">
<h2>Limitations<a class="headerlink" href="#limitations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>InaSAFE is still a new project. The current code development started
in earnest in March 2011 and there is still much to be done.
However, we work on the philosophy that stakeholders should have access
to the development and source code from the very beginning and invite
comments, suggestions and contributions.</p>

<p>As such, InaSAFE currently has some limitations, including</p>

<ul>
  <li>Exposure data in the form of roads (or any other line feature) is not supported.</li>
  <li>Polygon area analysis (such as land use) is not supported.</li>
  <li>Population density data must be provided in WGS84 geographic coordinates</li>
  <li>Neither AIFDR, the World Bank, nor GFDRR take any responsibility for the correctness of
   outputs from InaSAFE or decisions derived as a consequence</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Supported By<a class="headerlink" href="#contact-details"
title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The development of InaSAFE has been supported by the Indonesian Disaster
Management Agency (BNPB) and AusAID, through the Australia-Indonesia Facility
for Disaster Reduction, as well as the World Bank and the Global Facility for
Disaster Reduction and Recovery. InaSAFE is a plugin built for the open
source <a href="http://qgis.org">Quantum GIS</a> application.</p>
